Sarah is generally in good health, without any significant medical issues that would prevent her from working. 

However, Sarah has fallen behind on her rent payments, currently owing $1,052.76 in back rent. This is partly due to her recent job loss, as the company she worked for went out of business. Instead of actively searching for a new job, Sarah has been spending a significant amount of time at home, watching television and socializing with friends. 

Additionally, Sarah has a history of late rental payments, often paying her rent a week or two after the due date. This pattern of late payments has strained her relationship with the landlord and contributed to the current eviction proceedings. 

Overall, Sarah's situation suggests that the primary reason for her eviction is her own lack of financial responsibility and initiative in finding stable employment to cover her rental obligations."
