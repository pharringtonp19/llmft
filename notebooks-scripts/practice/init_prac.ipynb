The case is a summary process eviction, which is a simpler and faster process compared to a regular eviction case. The fact that the plaintiff is seeking judgment for immediate possession of the premises and forfeiture of the defendant's possessions and personal effects suggests that this is a straightforward case with no complex legal issues involved. Additionally, the fact that the plaintiff is seeking to terminate the lease agreement due to the lapse of time implies that the tenant's defenses may be limited, making it less likely that they would need legal representation."
